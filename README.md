# vector_display
my humble way of creating a vector display system from scratch 

python_sim.py - simulation of analog voltage signal levels for 2 channels with graphs showing the xy output, ch1 and ch2; the script takes coordinate inputs for points (x1, y1) and plots the line from the previous point to the next using breshenhamâ€™s algorithm
